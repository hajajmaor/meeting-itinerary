### What is it?

You have a meeting in your apartment building, let's say a tenant meeting. Everyone wants to see and add a `topic` for this meeting. The building's owner or maintenance company wants to write down his answers and present them to everyone so they can see them later.

There are already two users in this project, one as a 'user' and one as an `admin.` Everyone can see everything. A `user` can add topics, while an `admin` can also `comment` on topics.

This project was built in three days. It's not perfect or complete, but it was fun to try and learn React.js and Django.

Add issues, read the code, add comments, and reach out if you want.

Enjoy,

Maor Meir Hajaj
